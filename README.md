# Getting Started with Your React Application

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), a powerful tool to kickstart React projects with a modern configuration.

## Available Scripts

Within the project directory, you can execute the following commands:

### `npm start`

Launches the application in development mode.

- Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to view the app.
- The app automatically reloads when code changes are saved.
- Check the console for any lint or runtime errors.

### `npm test`

Runs the test suite in interactive watch mode.

- Refer to the [Running Tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) guide for detailed instructions.

### `npm run build`

Generates an optimized production build in the `build` directory.

- Bundles React in production mode for optimal performance.
- Minifies the code and includes hashed filenames for caching.
- Your app is now ready for deployment.

For more information, consult the [Deployment Guide](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment).

### `npm run eject`

> **Warning:** This action is irreversible.

If you need full control over the build tool and configurations, use the `eject` command. It extracts all configuration files and dependencies (e.g., Webpack, Babel, ESLint) into your project.

- After ejecting, you have complete control but assume responsibility for maintaining the configuration.
- For most cases, the default setup is sufficient, and ejecting may not be necessary.
